	abstract = {Plant imports by the North American horticultural industry risk the accidental introduction of harmful nonnative species. An annual license fee paid by the industry would reduce this risk while raising funds for research, screening imported species, education, and the eradication of past plant invasions. However, implementing such a fee requires information on how long it takes introduced species to become established and on their spread rates and environmental damages. Implementing such a policy would be challenging in terms of the scientific data required to estimate the correct tax. There is also limited support among stakeholders for an annual fee compared with other policy options to stop invasives. The preferred policy is to screen all newly introduced plants and to ban those species with a high likelihood of becoming a potential invasive. Mandatory implementation of this scheme is preferable to voluntary implementation by the horticultural industry.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, mounting evidence has shown the pervasive and escalating harmful impacts of invasive alien species on native species and ecosystems. Thousands of non-native species are established in the United States and many more worldwide. Few areas appear immune to invasions, some of which unfold over decades to centuries as species' ranges slowly expand across the landscape. A plethora of ecological effects have been attributed to invasive species, and other global change processes and widespread habitat destruction will likely multiply these effects. Many conservationists now consider invasive species among the top threats to biological diversity and are grappling with identifying pragmatic, effective solutions. They know that the future will involve mixed assemblages of native and non-native species and have important questions about which invasive species to tackle and which ones to ignore, and even whether to deliberately introduce certain species for restoration. Addressing these issues will push hard against the limits of today's ecological knowledge and our ability to predict the long-term ecological consequences of such decisions. Better envisioning the conservation goals, though, could help to guide the science.},

	abstract = {Summary Weed management requires a better understanding of the dynamics of the weed seedbank, which is a primary source of weeds in a field. Seeds reaching the ground after seed rain replenish the seedbank and therefore contribute to future weed infestations. Our investigation is based on the hypothesis that a permanent vegetation cover, such as a grassland, can prevent weed seeds from reaching the ground. Therefore, we developed an innovative experimental device to simulate in controlled conditions the seed rain of 12 weed species (Capsella bursa-pastoris, Conyza canadensis, Myosotis arvensis, Papaver rhoeas, Poa annua, Polygonum aviculare, Ranunculus sp., Rumex obtusifolius, Sonchus asper, Stellaria media, Taraxacum officinale and Veronica persicaria). We quantified the interception of weed seeds by a grass cover. Grass cover height, seed size and seed appendage (e.g. pappus, wing or awn) increased seed interception, in contrast to seed weight and shape index. From these results, we established a linear model to predict weed seed interception by a grass cover as a function of their seed trait values. The relationship between the predicted interception and weed community dynamics observed in grasslands was negative for some species, indicating that other processes may be involved depending on weed species. The weed seed interception model will be incorporated into an existing model of weed population dynamics to simulate the impact of grassland insertion into arable crop rotations.},

The capitula mowed later than 4 days after the start of this period and desiccated at 25°C produce viable seeds. If cut and prostrated on insolated ground inflorescences can experience temperatures exceeding 50°C which may impair seed viability. We determined the effect of desiccation temperature (5, 15, 25, 35, 45 or 55°C) on viability of ripening seeds using inflorescences harvested on September 5, 2008 at Prague-Ruzyne (50°05'N, 14°18'09 E), five days after flowering ceased (about 4 days before seed dispersal). As control, ripe seeds were collected at dispersal on the same day and desiccated at identical temperatures. Desiccated seeds were germinated at constant 17°C. Ripening seeds of maturing capitula only remained germinable if desiccation temperatures were ≤ 35°C (optimum 25°C) and were killed at 45 and 55°C. The viability of ripe seed was not affected by any of the desiccation temperatures. Time of germination of 50\% seeds that germinated was significantly shorter in ripe than ripening seeds. Exposure of mowed dandelion inflorescences on insolated ground (solarization) may thus decrease production of viable seeds because of high temperatures experienced during desiccation.},

	abstract = {As shown for other valuable crops, transplanting of wild rubber-producing Taraxacum koksaghyz (Tks) could be an option to counteract poor field emergence and stand establishment after direct seeding. Field trials (spring planting, autumn harvest) were conducted in 2012 and 2013 on a loamy soil (Quedlinburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Central Germany) to investigate the influence of different planting beds (flat, ridge) and planting densities (222,222 plants/ha, 88,889/133,333 plants/ha) on the yield performance of Tks. Between planting date and harvest significant plant losses of 43–48\% occurred across all treatments in both trial years. Major plant losses occurred within the first month after transplanting. The achieved planting density ({APD}) at harvest was significantly influenced by year, targeted planting density ({TPD}) and type of planting bed. Nearly all yield parameters were significantly influenced by the year of cultivation. There was a significant advantage of ridge over flat bed cultivation regarding achieved planting density, fresh root yield per hectare, and fresh/dry root yield per plant in the season 2013 and within the reduced planting density. In ridge cultivation root yield parameters were increased by 5–13\%. Furthermore planting density had a significant effect on biomass yield. There were weak to strong positive linear correlations (r = −0.35 to 0.75) between achieved planting density and biomass per hectare (fresh/dry root/leaf) and moderate negative correlations (r = −0.49 to 0.57) with individual plant yield (fresh/dry root/leaf, rubber/inulin). The presented study demonstrates that transplanting of Tks on ridges can be an option to increase root yield of Tks and that the focus of future research activities should be laid on an optimization of Tks transplant production and management in the field.},

	abstract = {Abstract The germination responses of a nondormant fraction of a seed population of Taraxacum officinale Weber at constant temperatures in the range 7–34°C were analysed through a time-course study. Maximal percentage germination (approximately 90\%) was attained at temperatures 10–18°C, where simple linear relationships were observed between the temperature and the germination rates, i.e. the reciprocals of the time taken to germinate by subpopulations with 20–80\% germination. There was a variation in the required ‘thermal times’ (θ) which characterized the linear relationships, the distribution of which could be approximated for the seed population by the following distribution function: where m is the median of the distribution, and A is a shape parameter characterizing the pattern of the distribution. Final percentage germination decreased with increasing temperature from 20 to 32°C, where the final percentage germination vs. temperature plotted on a normal probability scale yielded a straight line, indicating the normality of the distribution of the upper limit temperature in the seed population. The estimated mean and standard deviation were 27.25 ± 3.75°C. The rate of germination for the subpopulation with 20–80\% germination also decreased with increases in the temperature from 22 to 30°C. If the relationships between the temperature within this range and the rate for the subpopulations with 20–80\% germination were approximated by the regression lines, the negative ‘thermal time’ characterizing the yielded linear relationship would have a distribution which could be approximated by the same function with the required thermal time for the relationship of suboptimal range. The parameters m and A for the negative ‘thermal time’ were determined to be 2870 K h and 1.7 × 10-10 K-3 h-3.},

Summary The ability to germinate across different environments has been considered an important trait of invasive plant species that allows for establishment success in new habitats. Using two alien congener species of Asteraceae –Taraxacum officinale (invasive) and Taraxacum laevigatum laevigatum (non-invasive) – we tested the hypothesis that invasive species germinate better than non-invasives under various conditions. The germination patterns of Taraxacum brevicorniculatum, a contaminant found in seeds of the crop Taraxacum kok-saghyz, were also investigated to evaluate its invasive potential. In four experiments, we germinated seeds along gradients of alternating temperature, constant temperature (with or without light), water potential and following accelerated ageing. Neither higher nor lower germination per se explained invasion success for the Taraxacum species tested here. At alternating temperature, the invasive T. officinale had higher germination than or similar to the non-invasive T. laevigatum. Contrary to predictions, T. laevigatum exhibited higher germination than T. officinale in environments of darkness, low water potential or after the seeds were exposed to an ageing process. These results suggested a complicated role of germination in the success of T. officinale. Taraxacum brevicorniculatum showed the highest germination among the three species in all environments. The invasive potential of this species is thus unclear and will probably depend on its performance at other life stages along environmental gradients.},

	abstract = {With approximately 60 Pg of carbon (C) released as {CO}2 annually, the decomposition of dead organic matter feeds the major terrestrial global {CO}2 flux to the atmosphere. Macroclimate control over this critical C flux facilitates the parametrization of the C cycle in Earth system models and the understanding of climate change effects on the global C balance. Yet, the long-standing paradigm of climate control was recently challenged by the so far underestimated environmental heterogeneity at local scales, questioning the conceptual framework of thousands of decomposition studies and accuracy of current predictive models. Using three complementary decomposition experiments at a European scale, we showed that macroclimate and litter characteristics largely control plant litter decomposition, reaffirming the role of macroclimate as an integrative decomposition driver through direct environmental control and by influencing co-evolving local plant and decomposer communities. Neglecting this latter indirect effect, commonly used standard litter types overrated micro-environmental control and failed to predict local decomposition of plot-specific litter. Our data help clarify a key question on the regulation of the global C cycle by identifying the relative role of control factors over decomposition and the scales at which they matter and by highlighting sources of confusion in the literature.},
